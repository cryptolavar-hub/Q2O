## Summary

### Key Findings

- Utilize the <input type='file'> element for profile picture uploads to ensure compatibility across browsers. Refer to MDN documentation for implementation details.
- Leverage AWS S3 for storing uploaded profile pictures, ensuring scalability and durability. Use the AWS SDK to handle uploads and manage permissions effectively.
- Implement image processing using libraries like Sharp or Pillow to resize and optimize profile pictures before storage, improving load times and reducing bandwidth usage.
- Serve responsive images using the 'srcset' attribute to deliver appropriately sized images based on the user's device, enhancing performance and user experience.
- Ensure proper validation of uploaded images, including file type and size checks, to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure only valid images are processed.

### Code Examples

#### Example 1
**Source**: Example: Image upload with client-side validation
**Language**: javascript
```javascript
const input = document.getElementById('fileInput');
input.addEventListener('change', function() {
    const file = this.files[0];
    if (file && file.size < 2000000 && file.type.match('image.*')) {
        // Proceed with upload
    } else {
        alert('Invalid file type or size.');
    }
});
```

#### Example 2
**Source**: Example: Server-side image processing with Flask and Pillow
**Language**: python
```python
from flask import Flask, request
from PIL import Image
import io

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_image():
    file = request.files['file']
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        img = Image.open(file.stream)
        img = img.resize((300, 300))  # Resize image
        img.save('path/to/save/image.jpg')
        return 'Image uploaded successfully!'
    return 'Invalid file type!'
