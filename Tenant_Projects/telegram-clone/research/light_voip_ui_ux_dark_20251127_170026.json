    "Implement WebRTC for real-time communication: Utilize the WebRTC API for peer-to-peer audio and video calls, ensuring low latency and high-quality interactions.",
    "Leverage Twilio or Agora SDKs for VoIP: Use Twilio or Agora's SDKs for simplified integration of VoIP services, which provide robust features like call recording and analytics.",
    "Design for Dark and Light modes: Ensure your UI/UX supports both Dark and Light modes by using CSS variables for colors and providing a toggle switch for user preference.",
    "Optimize for mobile responsiveness: Use flexible grid layouts and media queries to ensure your VoIP application is fully responsive across various mobile devices and screen sizes.",
    "Implement user authentication: Secure your VoIP application by integrating OAuth 2.0 for user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can make calls.",
    "Use JSON for data interchange: Standardize on JSON for API responses and requests to maintain compatibility across different services and ease data handling.",
    "Monitor performance metrics: Implement logging and monitoring for call quality metrics (e.g., jitter, latency) to identify and resolve performance issues proactively.",
    "Avoid hardcoding sensitive information: Store API keys and sensitive configurations in environment variables or secure vaults to prevent exposure in your codebase.",
    "Test across multiple browsers: Ensure compatibility by testing your VoIP application across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to address any discrepancies in WebRTC support.",
    "Consider security best practices: Use HTTPS for all communications and implement end-to-end encryption for VoIP calls to protect user data from interception."
