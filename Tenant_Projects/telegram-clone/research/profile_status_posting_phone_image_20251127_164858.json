    "Insight 1: Utilize the Graph API for Facebook to post status updates by making a POST request to '/user/feed' with the required parameters such as message, link, and media attachments.",
    "Insight 2: For Twitter, use the 'statuses/update' endpoint to post tweets. Ensure to include the 'status' parameter for text and 'media_ids' for attaching images or videos, adhering to the media upload process beforehand.",
    "Insight 3: When posting to Instagram, leverage the Media API to create a media object. Use the 'user/media' endpoint to upload images or videos, and ensure to handle the media upload in two steps: first upload, then publish.",
    "Insight 4: Implement OAuth 2.0 for authentication across all platforms. Each API requires a valid access token to authorize requests, so ensure to manage token generation and expiration effectively.",
    "Insight 5: Be aware of rate limits imposed by each API. For example, Twitter limits the number of tweets you can post in a 15-minute window, so implement error handling to manage 'rate limit exceeded' responses.",
    "Insight 6: Use JSON as the data format for API requests and responses. Ensure that your application can parse and serialize JSON data correctly to avoid issues with data transmission.",
    "Insight 7: Always validate and sanitize user inputs before sending them to the APIs to prevent injection attacks and ensure compliance with platform policies.",
    "Insight 8: Implement error handling for API responses. Check for common HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized) and provide meaningful feedback to users.",
    "Insight 9: Optimize media files for size and format before uploading. Each platform has specific requirements for file types and sizes, which can affect upload success and performance.",
    "Insight 10: Consider user privacy settings when posting on behalf of users. Ensure that your application respects user permissions and complies with platform guidelines regarding data sharing."
