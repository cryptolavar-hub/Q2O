    "Utilize WebSockets for real-time communication in your instant messaging application, as they provide a persistent connection for low-latency message delivery.",
    "Leverage Firebase Realtime Database for storing and syncing messages, which allows for automatic updates across clients without needing to refresh the page.",
    "Implement Firebase Authentication to manage user identities securely, ensuring that only authenticated users can send and receive messages.",
    "Incorporate Firebase Cloud Messaging to handle push notifications, allowing users to receive alerts for new messages even when the app is not active.",
    "Adopt a structured data format (e.g., JSON) for messages to ensure compatibility across different platforms and ease of parsing.",
    "Avoid common pitfalls such as failing to handle WebSocket connection errors gracefully; implement reconnection logic to maintain a stable user experience.",
    "Use Firestore instead of Realtime Database if you require more complex querying capabilities or need to scale your application with more structured data.",
    "Ensure that all sensitive data transmitted over WebSockets is encrypted using TLS to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Implement rate limiting on message sending to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage among users, especially in high-traffic scenarios.",
    "Regularly test the performance of your messaging system under load to identify bottlenecks and optimize for scalability."
