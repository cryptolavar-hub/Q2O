    "Implement WebRTC for real-time communication: Utilize the react-native-webrtc library to enable VoIP capabilities in your React Native app, ensuring low-latency audio and video calls.",
    "Leverage native modules for advanced features: If you need functionalities not covered by React Native libraries, create custom native modules for both Android and iOS to access platform-specific VoIP features.",
    "Use VoIP push notifications: Integrate the react-native-voip-push-notification library to handle incoming calls even when the app is in the background, ensuring users receive calls reliably.",
    "Follow best practices for call quality: Optimize audio and video codecs based on network conditions and implement echo cancellation and noise suppression for improved call quality.",
    "Ensure secure communication: Use DTLS and SRTP for encrypting media streams in WebRTC to protect user data during calls, adhering to security best practices.",
    "Implement user authentication: Use OAuth2 or JWT for secure user authentication and authorization when accessing VoIP services, ensuring that only authorized users can make calls.",
    "Design for cross-platform compatibility: Test your VoIP implementation on both Android and iOS devices to ensure consistent performance and user experience across platforms.",
    "Monitor performance metrics: Track call quality metrics such as jitter, packet loss, and latency to identify and resolve issues proactively, enhancing user satisfaction.",
    "Handle network changes gracefully: Implement logic to manage call states and reconnect as necessary when network conditions change, providing a seamless user experience.",
    "Utilize RESTful APIs for backend integration: Ensure your NextJS frontend communicates effectively with your backend services using RESTful APIs to manage user data and call logs."
