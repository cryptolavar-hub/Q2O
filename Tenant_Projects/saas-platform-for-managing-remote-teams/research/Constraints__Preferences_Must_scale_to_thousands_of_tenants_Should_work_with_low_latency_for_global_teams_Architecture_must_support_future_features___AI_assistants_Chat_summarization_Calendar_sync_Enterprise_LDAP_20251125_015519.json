    "\"**Tenant Isolation is Paramount:** Choose a robust isolation strategy (e.g., separate schemas, row-level security with `tenant_id`, or dedicated infrastructure) to prevent data leakage and ensure compliance. This decision impacts security, performance, and cost.\",",
    "\"**Global Distribution Requires Geo-Aware Data & Services:** Implement multi-region deployments with geo-distributed databases (e.g., CockroachDB, DynamoDB Global Tables) and intelligent routing (e.g., DNS-based, service mesh) to minimize latency for global teams and ensure data sovereignty.\",",
    "\"**Event-Driven Architecture for Extensibility:** Leverage message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) and event streams to decouple services. This is crucial for integrating future features like AI assistants (processing events for context), chat summarization (asynchronous processing), and calendar sync.\",",
    "\"**Kubernetes Multi-tenancy via Namespaces & Policies:** Utilize Kubernetes namespaces for logical tenant separation, combined with Network Policies for network isolation, Resource Quotas for fair resource allocation, and RBAC for access control within and between tenants.\",",
    "\"**Centralized Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Implement a robust, scalable IAM solution (e.g., Auth0, Okta, Keycloak) supporting OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for applications and SAML/LDAP for enterprise integration. Fine-grained authorization (RBAC/ABAC) is essential.\",",
    "\"**Observability for Thousands of Tenants:** Implement a comprehensive observability stack (centralized logging, distributed tracing, metrics) with tenant-aware filtering and aggregation to diagnose issues quickly across a large, distributed system.\",",
    "\"**Automated Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use tools like Terraform or Pulumi to define and manage infrastructure consistently across multiple regions and environments, enabling rapid provisioning and disaster recovery.\",",
    "\"**Performance Optimization at Every Layer:** Employ caching (CDN, Redis), asynchronous processing, database sharding, and service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for traffic management to ensure low latency and high throughput under load.\",",
    "\"**Security by Design for Multi-tenancy:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit, implement robust secrets management, enforce strict network segmentation, and conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specific to multi-tenant vulnerabilities.\"",
