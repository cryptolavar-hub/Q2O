    "\"**Event-Driven Architecture for Notifications:** Implementing assignments, mentions, and comments effectively requires an event-driven approach to trigger real-time notifications (in-app, email, push) to relevant users without blocking core operations.\",",
    "\"**Robust Relational Data Modeling:** A well-designed relational database schema is crucial for managing the complex relationships between tasks, users, assignments, comments, and mentions, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.\",",
    "\"**Asynchronous Processing is Key:** Operations like sending notifications, parsing mentions, or updating search indexes should be handled asynchronously to maintain responsiveness and scalability of the main application.\",",
    "\"**Clear Authorization and Access Control:** Every action (assigning, commenting, mentioning, editing/deleting) must be strictly governed by granular authorization rules to ensure users can only perform actions they are permitted to.\",",
    "\"**Real-time User Experience:** Features like live comment updates, instant mention notifications, and immediate assignment changes significantly enhance user engagement and collaboration, often requiring WebSocket or similar real-time communication protocols.\",",
    "\"**Scalability through Indexing and Caching:** As the volume of tasks, comments, and users grows, efficient database indexing, query optimization, and strategic caching are essential to maintain performance.\",",
    "\"**Comprehensive Input Validation:** User-generated content (comments, mentions) must undergo rigorous validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS and ensure data quality.\",",
    "\"**Auditability and Versioning:** Tracking changes to assignments, and allowing editing/deletion with an audit trail for comments, provides transparency and accountability, which is critical for collaborative environments.\"",
