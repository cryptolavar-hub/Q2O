    "\"**OAuth 2.0 for Authorization, OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Authentication:** While OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework, OIDC builds on top of it to provide identity layer, making it suitable for user login and registration flows by providing an `id_token` (JWT) with user identity information.\",",
    "\"**JWTs as Bearer Tokens:** JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are the standard format for access tokens and ID tokens in OAuth/OIDC. They are self-contained, digitally signed, and often encrypted, allowing resource servers to validate them without directly querying the authorization server for every request.\",",
    "\"**Separation of Concerns:** The Identity Provider (IdP) handles user authentication (login/registration) and issues tokens. The Client Application (frontend) initiates the OAuth flow. The Resource Server (backend API) validates tokens to grant access to protected resources (dashboard data).\",",
    "\"**Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is Standard:** For web and mobile applications (public clients), the Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is the recommended and most secure OAuth 2.0 flow for obtaining tokens.\",",
    "\"**Access Token vs. Refresh Token:** Access tokens (JWTs) are short-lived and used to access protected resources. Refresh tokens are long-lived, securely stored, and used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires, minimizing re-authentication.\",",
    "\"**Statelessness and Scalability:** JWTs enable stateless authentication on the resource server side, as all necessary user information and claims are contained within the token itself, reducing database lookups per request and improving scalability.\",",
    "\"**Secure Token Storage is Critical:** Access tokens should be stored securely (e.g., HTTP-only, secure cookies for web; secure storage for mobile). Refresh tokens must be stored with even greater care due to their long lifespan and power.\",",
    "\"**Comprehensive Token Validation:** Resource servers must rigorously validate JWTs, including signature, expiration, issuer, audience, and any custom claims, to prevent unauthorized access and token tampering.\"",
