    "\"**Flexbox is Fundamental:** React Native uses Flexbox for layout, making it the primary tool for creating flexible and adaptive UIs that respond to different screen sizes and orientations.\",",
    "\"**Avoid Hardcoding Dimensions:** Relying on fixed `width` and `height` values is a common pitfall. Instead, use relative units, percentages, or the `Dimensions` API/`useWindowDimensions` hook for dynamic sizing.\",",
    "\"**`useWindowDimensions` for Reactivity:** The `useWindowDimensions` hook (preferred over `Dimensions.get`) provides real-time updates to screen dimensions, crucial for handling orientation changes and multi-window modes (e.g., split screen on tablets).\",",
    "\"**Scale UI Elements with `PixelRatio`:** For consistent visual size across devices with varying pixel densities, use `PixelRatio.get()` or `PixelRatio.roundToNearestPixel()` to scale fonts, images, and other fixed-size elements.\",",
    "\"**Platform and Device Specificity:** Leverage the `Platform` API for platform-specific logic/styles and consider creating separate component files (`.ios.js`, `.android.js`) for more complex platform-specific UIs.\",",
    "\"**Tablets Require Distinct Layouts:** Responsive design for 'desktop' in React Native often means optimizing for tablets. This typically involves more than just scaling; it requires re-thinking layout structures (e.g., master-detail views, multi-column layouts).\",",
    "\"**`SafeAreaView` is Essential:** Always wrap your top-level content in `SafeAreaView` to ensure UI elements are not obscured by device notches, status bars, or home indicators on iOS and Android.\",",
    "\"**Test Across Diverse Devices:** Thorough testing on a range of emulators/simulators and physical devices with different screen sizes, aspect ratios, and pixel densities is critical to validate responsiveness.\"",
