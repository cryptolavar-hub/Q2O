  "best_practices": [
    "**Audience-Centric Writing**: Tailor content, language, and depth to the target audience (e.g., beginners, experts, developers, end-users).",
    "**Accuracy and Currency**: Ensure documentation is always up-to-date with the latest code and features. Integrate documentation updates into the development workflow.",
    "**Clarity and Conciseness**: Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it clearly. Get straight to the point.",
    "**Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and style across all documentation. Use a style guide (e.g., Google, Microsoft).",
    "**Structure and Navigation**: Organize content logically with clear headings, tables of contents, and internal links. Use frameworks like Di\u00e1taxis (Tutorials, How-to guides, Reference, Explanation).",
    "**Examples and Visuals**: Provide concrete code examples, screenshots, diagrams, and flowcharts to illustrate concepts and usage.",
    "**Version Control**: Store documentation in the same version control system as the code (e.g., Git) to track changes, enable collaboration, and link docs to specific code versions.",
    "**Automated Generation**: Leverage tools (e.g., Sphinx, Javadoc, Doxygen, OpenAPI generators) to generate documentation directly from code or structured specifications.",
    "**Feedback Mechanisms**: Provide clear ways for users to report issues, suggest improvements, or ask questions about the documentation.",
    "**Testing Documentation**: Treat documentation like code; review it, test examples, and potentially integrate linting or spell-checking into CI/CD."

  "common_pitfalls": [
    "**Outdated Documentation**: The most common pitfall. Documentation that doesn't reflect the current state of the software is worse than no documentation, as it can mislead users.",
    "**Lack of Examples**: Abstract explanations without practical examples make it difficult for users to understand how to apply the information.",
    "**Poor Structure/Navigation**: Users get lost or can't find relevant information quickly, leading to frustration and abandonment.",
    "**Assuming Prior Knowledge**: Writing for an expert audience when the target is a beginner, or vice-versa, alienates users.",
    "**Inconsistent Terminology/Style**: Creates confusion and makes the documentation feel unprofessional and unreliable.",
    "**Documentation as an Afterthought**: Delaying documentation until the end of a project often results in rushed, incomplete, and low-quality content.",
    "**Ignoring Feedback**: Not acting on user feedback about documentation issues leads to persistent problems and user dissatisfaction.",
    "**Over-documentation/Under-documentation**: Providing too much irrelevant detail or too little essential information. Balance is key.",
    "**Lack of Versioning**: Without clear versioning, users don't know if the documentation applies to their specific software version."
  ],
  "implementation_patterns": [
    "**Docs-as-Code**: Treat documentation like code. Write in plain text formats (Markdown, reStructuredText), store in Git, use static site generators (MkDocs, Sphinx, Docusaurus), and integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated publishing.",
    "**API-First Documentation**: For APIs, design and document the API contract (e.g., using OpenAPI) *before* or *in parallel* with implementation. Use tools to generate interactive documentation (Swagger UI, Redoc) directly from the specification.",
    "**In-Code Documentation**: Embed documentation directly within source code using docstrings (Python), Javadoc (Java), TSDoc (TypeScript), or similar mechanisms. Tools can then extract this for API reference documentation.",
    "**Static Site Generators (SSG)**: Use tools like Sphinx (Python), MkDocs (Python), Docusaurus (React/MDX), Hugo (Go), Jekyll (Ruby) to build fast, version-controlled documentation websites from plain text files.",
    "**Integrated IDE Documentation**: Leverage IDE features that display docstrings/comments on hover or provide quick access to function signatures and parameter descriptions.",
    "**Living Documentation**: Documentation that is automatically generated or updated from tests, code, or system behavior, ensuring it always reflects the current state (e.g., BDD scenarios, architecture diagrams generated from code).",
    "**Modular Documentation**: Break down large documentation sets into smaller, reusable modules or topics. This improves maintainability and allows for easier content reuse across different guides."

    "apis_required": [
      "**Version Control Systems (VCS)**: Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for storing documentation source files.",
      "**CI/CD Pipelines**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI for automated building, linting, testing, and deployment of documentation.",
      "**Static Site Generators**: APIs/CLI for tools like Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus to build documentation.",
      "**API Specification Tools**: OpenAPI/Swagger tools for generating and rendering API documentation.",
      "**Search Engines**: Integration with search services (e.g., Algolia DocSearch, ElasticSearch) for full-text search capabilities within documentation sites.",
      "**Issue Trackers/Feedback Systems**: Jira, GitHub Issues, custom feedback forms for collecting user input on documentation."
    ],
    "data_formats": [
      "**Markdown (.md, .mdown, .markdown)**: Widely used for simplicity and compatibility.",
      "**reStructuredText (.rst)**: Powerful, used extensively with Sphinx for complex documentation.",
      "**AsciiDoc (.adoc, .asciidoc)**: Another rich plain-text markup language, often used for books and technical articles.",
      "**YAML/JSON**: For API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger), configuration files for documentation generators.",
      "**HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the final rendered documentation website.",
      "**PNG/JPEG/SVG**: For images, diagrams, and screenshots."
    ]
  },
  "performance_considerations": [
    "**Static Site Generation**: Generate static HTML files for documentation sites to ensure fast loading times and low server overhead. Avoid dynamic content where not strictly necessary.",
    "**Image Optimization**: Compress images and use appropriate formats (e.g., WebP, SVG for vector graphics) to reduce page load times.",
    "**Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for images and other heavy assets to improve initial page load performance.",
    "**CDN Usage**: Distribute documentation assets (images, CSS, JS) via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve content faster to geographically dispersed users.",
    "**Efficient Search**: Implement fast and relevant search functionality (e.g., client-side search with Lunr.js or server-side with Algolia) to help users quickly find information.",
    "**Minification and Bundling**: Minify CSS and JavaScript files and bundle them to reduce file sizes and HTTP requests.",
    "**Browser Caching**: Configure appropriate HTTP caching headers to allow browsers to cache documentation assets, speeding up subsequent visits."
  ],
  "security_considerations": [
    "**Access Control**: For internal or sensitive documentation, implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., SSO, role-based access control) to restrict access to authorized personnel.",
    "**Data Confidentiality**: Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., internal network details, proprietary algorithms, unreleased features) is not exposed in public documentation.",
    "**Vulnerability Management**: Keep documentation generation tools and their dependencies updated to patch known security vulnerabilities.",
    "**Input Sanitization**: If documentation platforms allow user-generated content (e.g., comments, feedback), sanitize all inputs to prevent XSS, injection attacks, and other vulnerabilities.",
    "**Secure Hosting**: Host documentation on secure servers with proper firewall rules, regular security audits, and DDoS protection.",
    "**Version Control Security**: Ensure that the version control system hosting documentation is secure, with proper access controls and audit logging.",
    "**Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backups of documentation source files and generated artifacts to prevent data loss."
