    "\"**Data Source Heterogeneity is Key:** Team dashboards require integrating data from diverse sources (project management tools, communication platforms, HR systems, custom applications). A robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is fundamental.\",",
    "\"**Real-time vs. Batch Processing:** Determine which metrics require real-time updates (e.g., active users, recent activity) versus those that can be updated in batches (e.g., monthly KPIs, historical attendance). This impacts architecture choices (streaming vs. scheduled jobs).\",",
    "\"**Scalable Data Storage:** For historical attendance, time logs, and activity heatmaps, data volumes can grow rapidly. Choose a database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB, ClickHouse, or a data lake approach) that scales for time-series and analytical queries.\",",
    "\"**Interactive Visualization Frameworks:** Python offers powerful frameworks like Plotly Dash and Streamlit that enable rapid development of interactive dashboards and custom widgets without extensive front-end expertise, crucial for dynamic analytics.\",",
    "\"**Granularity and Aggregation:** Define the required data granularity for each metric. Store raw data where necessary, but pre-aggregate common views (daily, weekly, monthly summaries) to optimize dashboard load times and query performance.\",",
    "\"**User Experience (UX) is Paramount:** A dashboard is only useful if it's intuitive and provides actionable insights. Prioritize clear visualizations, logical layouts, and filtering capabilities. Gather user feedback iteratively.\",",
    "\"**Security and Access Control:** Team data, especially attendance and productivity, is highly sensitive. Implement robust authentication, authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC), and data encryption from the outset.\",",
    "\"**Observability and Monitoring:** Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting for data pipelines, database health, and dashboard performance. This ensures data freshness, system reliability, and quick issue resolution.\"",
