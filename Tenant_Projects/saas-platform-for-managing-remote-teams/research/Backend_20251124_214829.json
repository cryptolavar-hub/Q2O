    "\"API Rate Limits are Paramount: Sports data APIs often have strict rate limits (e.g., requests per second/minute/day). Ignoring these leads to temporary bans or service interruptions. Implement robust rate limit handling and caching strategies.\",",
    "\"Data Ingestion Requires Robustness: External APIs can be unreliable. Implement comprehensive error handling, retries with exponential backoff, and circuit breakers for API calls to ensure data ingestion resilience.\",",
    "\"Caching is Critical for Performance and Cost: Due to rate limits and the often static nature of historical sports data, caching frequently accessed data (scores, player stats, team info) is essential to reduce API calls and improve response times.\",",
    "\"Data Transformation and Normalization are Inevitable: Sports data from different providers often comes in varying formats and structures. A significant part of the backend's role is to transform and normalize this data into a consistent internal schema.\",",
    "\"Choose the Right Data Storage: Relational databases (PostgreSQL) are good for structured, normalized data. NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra) might be better for high-volume, less structured event data or time-series data (InfluxDB) for live scores.\",",
    "\"Asynchronous Processing for Scalability: For high-volume data ingestion or processing tasks, leverage asynchronous programming (e.g., Python's `asyncio`, message queues like RabbitMQ/Kafka) to avoid blocking and improve throughput.\",",
    "\"Webhooks vs. Polling: Prefer webhooks if the sports API supports them for real-time updates, as they are more efficient. If not, implement intelligent polling strategies with appropriate intervals to minimize API calls.\",",
    "\"API Key Management is a Security Priority: Never hardcode API keys. Use environment variables, secret management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), and ensure they are not exposed in logs or client-side code.\"",
