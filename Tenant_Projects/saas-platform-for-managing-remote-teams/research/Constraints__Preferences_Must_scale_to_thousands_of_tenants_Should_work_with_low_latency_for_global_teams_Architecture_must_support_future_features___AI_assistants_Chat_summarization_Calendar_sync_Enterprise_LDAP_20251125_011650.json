    "\"**Multi-Tenancy Model is Foundational:** The choice between shared database with tenant ID, separate schemas, or separate databases per tenant dictates scalability, isolation, and operational complexity. A shared database with robust tenant ID filtering is often the most cost-effective and scalable for thousands of tenants, provided strong data isolation is enforced.\",",
    "\"**Global Distribution Requires Regional Deployments:** To achieve low latency for global teams, deploy application services and data stores in multiple geographical regions. Utilize global load balancing (e.g., AWS Route 53, Azure Traffic Manager, GCP Global External Load Balancer) to route users to the nearest healthy region.\",",
    "\"**Asynchronous Processing is Critical for Responsiveness:** Long-running operations like AI model inference, chat summarization, and calendar synchronization must be offloaded to background task queues (e.g., Celery, Dramatiq) to prevent blocking user requests and maintain low latency for interactive features.\",",
    "\"**Microservices Architecture for Modularity and Scalability:** Decompose the application into smaller, independently deployable services (e.g., User Service, Chat Service, AI Service, Calendar Sync Service). This allows individual services to scale independently, be developed by separate teams, and use specialized technologies where appropriate.\",",
    "\"**Robust Identity and Access Management (IAM) is Paramount:** Integrate with enterprise identity providers (LDAP, SAML, OpenID Connect) for Single Sign-On (SSO) and user provisioning. Implement fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to ensure tenants and users only access authorized resources.\",",
    "\"**Data Locality and Replication for Performance and Resilience:** Store tenant data in regions geographically close to the majority of their users. Implement multi-region database replication (e.g., PostgreSQL with logical replication, Cassandra, DynamoDB Global Tables) for disaster recovery and read scaling.\",",
    "\"**Observability is Non-Negotiable:** Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and distributed tracing across all services. Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Datadog), metrics collection (Prometheus, Grafana), and tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry) are essential for diagnosing issues in a complex distributed system.\",",
    "\"**API Gateway for Centralized Control and Security:** Use an API Gateway (e.g., Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway, GCP API Gateway) to manage external API access, enforce authentication/authorization, rate limiting, caching, and request routing to various microservices.\"",
