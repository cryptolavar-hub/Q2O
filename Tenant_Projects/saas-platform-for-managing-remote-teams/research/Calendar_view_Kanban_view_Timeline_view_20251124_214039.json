    "\"**View Selection is Context-Driven:** Each view (Calendar, Kanban, Timeline) serves a distinct purpose. Calendar is best for time-bound events and scheduling, Kanban for workflow management and status tracking, and Timeline for sequential project progression and historical events.\",",
    "\"**Data Model Consistency is Crucial:** Regardless of the view, a consistent underlying data model for tasks/events (e.g., `id`, `title`, `description`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`, `assignee`, `priority`) simplifies data management and allows for easy switching between views.\",",
    "\"**Interactivity Enhances Usability:** Drag-and-drop functionality (especially in Kanban and Calendar), inline editing, and quick filters are essential for a dynamic and productive user experience across all view types.\",",
    "\"**Performance Scales with Data:** For large datasets, implementing virtualization (windowing) and efficient data fetching strategies (pagination, lazy loading) is critical to maintain responsiveness, especially in Timeline and Calendar views.\",",
    "\"**Accessibility is Non-Negotiable:** All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly, and adhere to WCAG guidelines. This includes proper ARIA attributes for drag-and-drop, date pickers, and status updates.\",",
    "\"**Responsive Design is a Must:** These views often contain a lot of information. Ensuring they are usable and aesthetically pleasing across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) requires careful responsive design and potentially simplified mobile-specific layouts.\",",
    "\"**Real-time Updates Improve Collaboration:** For project management tools, integrating real-time updates (e.g., via WebSockets) ensures all users see the most current state of tasks and projects, reducing conflicts and improving team coordination.\",",
    "\"**Customization for Branding & UX:** While using off-the-shelf components is efficient, the ability to customize styling and behavior to match brand guidelines and specific user workflows is important for a polished product.\"",
