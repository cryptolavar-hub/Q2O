    "\"**WebSockets for Bidirectional Server-Client Communication:** Ideal for persistent, low-latency, full-duplex communication between a client and a central server. Best suited for chat applications, live dashboards, notifications, and real-time data synchronization where a server acts as an intermediary.\",",
    "\"**WebRTC for Direct Peer-to-Peer Media & Data:** Designed for real-time, direct peer-to-peer communication, primarily for audio, video, and arbitrary data channels. Minimizes server load for media streams once a connection is established. Complex to implement due to signaling, NAT traversal (STUN/TURN), and browser compatibility.\",",
    "\"**Supabase Realtime for Database-Centric Real-time:** A managed, PostgreSQL-based real-time solution built on WebSockets. Simplifies adding real-time features like database change feeds, presence, and broadcast messaging. Excellent for applications requiring real-time updates based on database changes with minimal backend code.\",",
    "\"**Choose based on Use Case:** Use WebSockets for custom server-client data push/pull. Use WebRTC for direct user-to-user audio/video/data. Use Supabase Realtime for rapid development of data-driven real-time features tightly coupled with a PostgreSQL database.\",",
    "\"**Complexity vs. Control:** WebSockets offer maximum control but require significant server-side implementation and scaling effort. WebRTC is inherently complex due to network topology challenges. Supabase Realtime abstracts much of this complexity, offering ease of use at the cost of some control and vendor lock-in.\",",
    "\"**Scalability Considerations Differ:** WebSockets require careful server-side scaling (e.g., distributed Pub/Sub, load balancing). WebRTC offloads media bandwidth to peers. Supabase Realtime handles infrastructure scaling for you, up to its service limits.\",",
    "\"**Security is Paramount:** All real-time solutions require robust authentication, authorization, and encryption (WSS/TLS for WebSockets, SRTP for WebRTC media, JWT/RLS for Supabase) to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.\",",
    "\"**Network Resilience is Key:** Implement robust reconnection strategies, heartbeats, and error handling for all real-time connections, as network conditions are often unreliable.\",",
    "\"**Signaling is Universal (Except Supabase's Abstraction):** Both WebSockets (for custom applications) and WebRTC require a 'signaling' mechanism to establish initial connections and exchange metadata. Supabase Realtime handles this internally for its specific features.\"",
