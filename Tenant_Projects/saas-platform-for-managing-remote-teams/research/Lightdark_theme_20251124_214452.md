## Summary

### Key Findings

- "**CSS Variables are King for Theming:** Leverage CSS Custom Properties (variables) for defining theme-specific values (colors, fonts, spacing). This provides native browser performance, easy maintainability, and seamless integration with JavaScript for dynamic changes.",
- "**Prioritize `prefers-color-scheme`:** Respect the user's operating system preference using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. This should be the default behavior, with a manual toggle provided for override.",
- "**Persistence is Crucial:** Store the user's chosen theme (light/dark) in `localStorage` or cookies to ensure their preference persists across sessions and page reloads. This prevents a jarring flash of the default theme.",
- "**Prevent FOUC in Next.js (SSR):** On server-rendered pages, a 'Flash of Unstyled Content' (FOUC) can occur if the theme is applied client-side after initial render. Implement a small inline script in `_document.js` to read `localStorage` and apply the correct theme class before React hydrates.",
- "**Centralized Theme Management:** Use React Context API or a CSS-in-JS library's theming provider to centralize theme state and values, making them easily accessible throughout your component tree.",
- "**Accessibility is Non-Negotiable:** Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA or AAA) for both light and dark themes. Test text, interactive elements, and non-text content.",
- "**Semantic Naming:** Use semantic names for your CSS variables (e.g., `--color-text-primary`, `--color-background-default`) rather than literal color names (e.g., `--color-blue-500`). This makes themes more flexible and easier to manage.",
- "**CSS-in-JS Integration:** Most CSS-in-JS libraries (Styled Components, Emotion) offer robust theming solutions that integrate well with React Context, allowing you to define theme objects and access them within styled components."
