    "\"**Persistent Layout with Next.js:** Leverage Next.js's `_app.js` to wrap pages with a consistent layout component, ensuring the sidebar and topbar persist across route changes without re-mounting, which is crucial for state preservation and smooth transitions.\",",
    "\"**Component Composition for Modularity:** Break down the layout into distinct, reusable components (e.g., `Layout`, `Sidebar`, `Topbar`, `MainContent`). This enhances maintainability, readability, and allows for independent development and testing.\",",
    "\"**Responsive Design is Non-Negotiable:** Implement a mobile-first approach. The layout must adapt gracefully to various screen sizes, typically involving collapsing the sidebar into an off-canvas menu on smaller viewports and adjusting topbar elements.\",",
    "\"**Centralized State Management for UI:** Use React Context API or a lightweight state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) to manage global UI states like sidebar open/close status, ensuring components can interact with it without prop drilling.\",",
    "\"**Accessibility (A11y) from the Start:** Design with accessibility in mind. Ensure keyboard navigation, proper ARIA attributes for interactive elements (like sidebar toggles, navigation links), and sufficient color contrast for all UI elements.\",",
    "\"**Semantic HTML for Structure:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`) to provide meaningful structure to the document, aiding both accessibility and SEO.\",",
    "\"**Efficient Styling with Utility-First CSS or CSS-in-JS:** Utilize frameworks like Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling and responsiveness, or CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion) for component-scoped styles and dynamic theming.\"",
