    "\"**AI-Generated Code Requires Rigorous Validation:** While AI models can produce syntactically correct and often functional code, it is rarely production-ready without extensive human review, testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and security scanning. Blindly deploying AI-generated code is a critical pitfall.\",",
    "\"**Prompt Engineering is Paramount:** The quality and specificity of the input prompt directly correlate with the quality of the generated code. Effective prompt engineering involves clear requirements, desired language/framework, constraints, and examples (few-shot learning).\",",
    "\"**Hybrid Approach is Optimal:** The most effective strategy combines AI generation with human expertise. AI excels at boilerplate, scaffolding, and suggesting solutions, while humans provide critical thinking, architectural design, security oversight, and complex problem-solving.\",",
    "\"**Contextual Awareness is Key:** Models like GitHub Copilot leverage IDE context (open files, existing code) for highly relevant suggestions. For API-driven generation (OpenAI, Hugging Face), providing relevant code snippets, documentation, or schema definitions in the prompt significantly improves output quality.\",",
    "\"**Licensing and IP Concerns:** Code generated by models trained on vast public datasets (including open-source code) may carry implicit licensing obligations or intellectual property risks. Organizations must establish clear policies and potentially use tools to scan for license compliance.\",",
    "\"**Performance vs. Cost Trade-offs:** Larger, more capable models (e.g., GPT-4) offer superior code quality but come with higher latency and API costs. Smaller, fine-tuned models (e.g., from Hugging Face) can be more cost-effective and faster for specific domains, especially when self-hosted.\",",
    "\"**Security Vulnerabilities are a Risk:** AI-generated code can inadvertently introduce security flaws (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization). Integrating static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the development pipeline is crucial.\",",
    "\"**Iterative Refinement is Essential:** Code generation is often an iterative process. Initial generation serves as a starting point, followed by human-guided refinement, re-prompting, and incremental generation to achieve the desired outcome.\"",
