    "Utilize the Graph API to upload videos to Facebook, ensuring you follow the required authentication process using OAuth 2.0 to obtain a valid access token.",
    "Implement resumable uploads for larger video files by using the 'resumable upload' feature, which allows you to upload videos in chunks and resume interrupted uploads seamlessly.",
    "Ensure that your video files meet Facebook's specifications, including format (MP4 recommended), size (up to 10GB), and duration (up to 240 minutes) to avoid upload failures.",
    "Use the 'video' object in the Graph API to manage video metadata, including title, description, and privacy settings, to enhance user engagement with your content.",
    "Monitor API rate limits and error responses to handle failures gracefully, implementing retries with exponential backoff for transient errors during video uploads.",
    "Integrate webhooks to receive real-time notifications about video processing status and engagement metrics, allowing you to respond promptly to user interactions.",
    "Be aware of Facebook's content policies and community standards to avoid content rejection or account penalties when uploading videos to the platform.",
    "Test video uploads in a development environment using test users to ensure that your implementation works correctly before going live.",
    "Optimize video encoding settings for faster upload times and better playback performance, considering the use of H.264 codec and AAC audio for compatibility.",
    "Utilize the Graph API Explorer tool to experiment with API calls and understand the responses, which can aid in debugging and refining your video upload process."

    "Use a modular approach to separate concerns: create distinct functions for authentication, video uploading, and error handling.",
