    "1. Utilize the Graph API to upload videos by following the endpoint: POST /{user-id}/videos. Ensure you have the necessary permissions (publish_video) granted to your app.",
    "2. When uploading videos, use the videoupload endpoint to handle large files efficiently. This allows for resumable uploads and better error handling.",
    "3. Always include a title and description for your videos to enhance discoverability. Use the 'title' and 'description' fields in your API requests.",
    "4. Implement error handling for API responses, particularly for video uploads. Check for status codes and handle common errors like 400 (Bad Request) and 403 (Forbidden).",
    "5. Use the user/feed endpoint to share videos on a user's timeline after successful upload. Ensure you format the post correctly to include video links.",
    "6. Be aware of Facebook's video format requirements: MP4 is preferred, with a maximum file size of 4GB and a maximum duration of 240 minutes.",
    "7. Consider the privacy settings of the videos being uploaded. Use the 'privacy' parameter to control who can view the video (e.g., 'public', 'friends').",
    "8. Monitor the performance of video uploads by checking the response time and success rates. Use analytics to track engagement metrics post-upload.",
    "9. Ensure that you comply with Facebook's community standards and copyright policies when uploading content to avoid potential account restrictions.",
    "10. For integration, make sure to handle authentication using OAuth 2.0 to obtain access tokens required for API calls."
