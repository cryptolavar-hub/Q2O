    "\"**Robust Data Model is Paramount:** A well-designed database schema is critical for accurately tracking clock in/out, task timers, and activity logs, ensuring data integrity, historical accuracy, and efficient querying for reports. Consider relationships between users, teams, tasks, and time entries.\",",
    "\"**Timezone Handling is Non-Negotiable:** All time-related data (start/end times, activity timestamps) must be stored in UTC and converted to the user's local timezone only at the presentation layer to prevent inconsistencies and errors, especially in a distributed SaaS environment.\",",
    "\"**Real-time Updates Enhance UX:** For task-linked timers and activity logging, real-time feedback to the user (e.g., timer running, activity logged) via WebSockets significantly improves the user experience and perceived responsiveness of the platform.\",",
    "\"**Granular Activity Logging for Insights:** Beyond simple clock in/out, capturing specific activities (e.g., 'working on sprint planning', 'reviewing code', 'attending meeting') provides richer data for productivity analysis and automated summaries, enabling more actionable insights.\",",
    "\"**Efficient Data Aggregation for Reports:** Automated daily stats and summaries require efficient aggregation queries. Pre-calculating common metrics (e.g., daily total hours, task breakdown) or using materialized views can significantly improve report generation performance for large datasets.\",",
    "\"**Multi-tenancy Requires Careful Design:** As a SaaS platform, the system must securely separate data for different sports teams. Implement either a schema-based or row-based multi-tenancy approach, ensuring strict authorization checks on all data access.\",",
    "\"**Auditability and Data Correction:** Provide mechanisms for users/admins to review, edit, and correct time entries, but ensure an audit trail is maintained for all changes to preserve data integrity and accountability.\",",
    "\"**API-First Approach:** Design a clear, well-documented RESTful API for all time tracking functionalities, allowing the Next.js frontend to interact seamlessly and enabling future integrations with other services.\"",
