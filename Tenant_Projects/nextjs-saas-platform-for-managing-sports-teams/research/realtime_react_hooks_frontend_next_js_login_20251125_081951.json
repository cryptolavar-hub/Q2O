    "\"**Leverage Next.js Data Fetching Strategies:** Optimize page load times and user experience by strategically using `getServerSideProps` for dynamic, authenticated data (e.g., Dashboard, Team Management), `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` (ISR) for frequently updated but not real-time data (e.g., project lists), and client-side fetching for highly interactive or user-specific components.\",",
    "\"**Prioritize Robust Authentication & Authorization:** Implement a secure authentication solution like NextAuth.js for Login/Register, ensuring proper session management, credential storage, and role-based access control (RBAC) across all protected routes and API endpoints to manage team and project permissions effectively.\",",
    "\"**Adopt a Real-time Backend Service:** For Chat, Tasks, and Video Call signaling, integrate with a dedicated real-time service (e.g., Socket.IO, Pusher, Ably) or a custom WebSocket server. This offloads complexity and ensures scalable, low-latency communication crucial for a collaborative sports team platform.\",",
    "\"**Build a Reusable Component Library:** Develop a consistent UI/UX by creating a dedicated component library (Sidebar, Tables, Cards, Modals) using a framework like Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, or Radix UI. This accelerates development, maintains brand consistency, and improves maintainability across the application.\",",
    "\"**Implement Comprehensive CI/CD with Docker:** Containerize the Next.js application using multi-stage Dockerfiles for optimized image size and build times. Automate build, test, and deployment processes with GitHub Actions, targeting either Vercel for simplicity or AWS ECS for greater control and scalability.\",",
    "\"**Secure Environment Variable Management:** Utilize Next.js's built-in environment variable handling (`NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side, server-only for sensitive keys) and ensure secure injection during CI/CD and deployment. Never commit sensitive keys to version control.\",",
    "\"**Optimize WebRTC for Performance and Reliability:** For video calls, ensure proper STUN/TURN server setup to handle NAT traversal and relay media. Implement robust peer connection management, error handling, and UI feedback for connection status to provide a stable communication experience.\",",
    "\"**Strategic State Management:** For global application state (e.g., user info, notifications), use a lightweight global state manager (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, React Context). For complex, feature-specific state (e.g., chat messages, task lists), combine local component state with real-time updates from the backend.\"",
