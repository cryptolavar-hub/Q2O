    "\"**Data Aggregation is Central:** The core challenge and opportunity lie in effectively collecting, transforming, and aggregating diverse data sources (attendance, performance, time logs, usage stats) into meaningful metrics for display.\",",
    "\"**API-First Design for Flexibility:** A robust Python backend API is crucial to serve aggregated and raw data to the Next.js frontend, enabling dynamic dashboards and custom widget creation without tight coupling.\",",
    "\"**Visualization Library Choice Impacts UX:** Selecting appropriate Python libraries (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh) for backend data processing and potentially for generating static charts, or designing data structures for frontend libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, Recharts) is critical for interactive and insightful visualizations.\",",
    "\"**Performance Requires Proactive Planning:** Handling potentially large volumes of historical data for analytics (e.g., player performance over seasons) necessitates efficient database queries, caching strategies, and asynchronous processing for complex calculations.\",",
    "\"**Data Modeling is Key for Sports Context:** Design a flexible and extensible data model that accurately captures sports-specific entities (teams, players, games, training sessions, specific performance metrics like goals, assists, recovery time, etc.) and their relationships.\",",
    "\"**Security and Privacy are Paramount:** Given sensitive player performance and personal data, robust authentication, authorization, and data encryption are non-negotiable, especially for a SaaS platform.\",",
    "\"**Customization Drives Value:** The ability for users to define and configure their own KPIs and analytics widgets directly enhances the platform's utility and stickiness for different sports teams and roles (coaches, managers).\",",
    "\"**ETL/ELT for Data Pipelines:** Implement clear data pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load or Extract, Load, Transform) to ensure data quality, consistency, and availability for analytics, potentially using tools like Apache Airflow for orchestration.\"",
