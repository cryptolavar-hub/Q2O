    "\"**Centralized Data Model is Paramount:** For a business with multiple farms, a single, unified database schema for inventory and financial data, with clear farm identification, is critical for consolidated reporting and decision-making. Avoid siloed data per farm.\",",
    "\"**Granular Location Tagging:** Every inventory item, transaction, and asset must be explicitly linked to its specific farm location. This enables accurate farm-level P&L, inventory counts, and asset tracking.\",",
    "\"**Robust Accounting Principles:** Implement a double-entry accounting system with a well-defined Chart of Accounts. This ensures financial accuracy, compliance, and provides a clear picture of each farm's profitability and the overall business's financial health.\",",
    "\"**Real-time (or Near Real-time) Visibility:** Implement mechanisms for timely data synchronization from farms to the central system. This is crucial for accurate inventory levels, cash flow management, and responding quickly to operational changes or market conditions.\",",
    "\"**Scalability and Flexibility:** Design the system to easily accommodate new farms, additional inventory types, and evolving financial reporting requirements without significant architectural changes. Use modular components.\",",
    "\"**Comprehensive Audit Trails:** Every change to inventory levels, financial transactions, and master data (e.g., item prices) must be logged with timestamps and user information. This is vital for accountability, error tracing, and regulatory compliance.\",",
    "\"**Integration with External Systems:** Plan for integration with external services like market price feeds, weather data, accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero), and potentially IoT devices for automated inventory tracking or environmental monitoring.\",",
    "\"**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a robust RBAC system to control who can view, create, update, or delete inventory and financial data, especially across different farm locations and organizational roles (e.g., farm manager, accountant, administrator).\",",
    "\"**Automated Reporting and Analytics:** Develop automated reports for inventory valuation, farm-specific P&L, balance sheets, cash flow, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide actionable insights to management.\"",
