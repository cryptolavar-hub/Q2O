  "key_findings": [
    "Leverage WebRTC for real-time communication: Utilize WebRTC APIs for implementing VoIP services directly in the browser, ensuring low-latency audio and video streaming.",
    "Ensure mobile responsiveness: Design your VoIP interface using responsive design principles (e.g., CSS Flexbox or Grid) to provide a seamless experience across devices.",
    "Implement secure connections: Use HTTPS and WebRTC's DTLS/SRTP for encrypting media streams to protect user data and ensure compliance with security standards.",
    "Optimize for performance: Use adaptive bitrate streaming to adjust the quality of audio/video based on network conditions, improving user experience during fluctuating bandwidth.",
    "Integrate with existing APIs: Utilize Twilio's APIs for easy integration of VoIP features, including call handling and user authentication, to expedite development.",
    "Test across multiple devices: Conduct thorough testing on various mobile devices and browsers to identify and resolve compatibility issues early in the development process.",
    "Monitor and log call quality: Implement tools to monitor call quality metrics (e.g., jitter, latency) to proactively address performance issues and enhance user satisfaction.",
    "Avoid common pitfalls: Be cautious of browser compatibility issues with WebRTC; ensure to check for support in the target browsers before deploying.",
    "Use fallback mechanisms: Implement fallback options (e.g., traditional telephony) for users on unsupported devices or browsers to maintain accessibility.",
    "Document your architecture: Maintain clear documentation of your VoIP system architecture and integration points to facilitate future maintenance and onboarding of new developers."
