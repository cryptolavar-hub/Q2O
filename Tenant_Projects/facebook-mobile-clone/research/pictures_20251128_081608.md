## Summary

### Key Findings

- Utilize AWS S3 for scalable image storage; leverage its built-in versioning and lifecycle policies to manage image retention effectively.
- For Google Cloud Storage, implement resumable uploads to enhance user experience during large image uploads, ensuring reliability even in unstable network conditions.
- When uploading images, always set the appropriate Content-Encoding header to optimize delivery and reduce bandwidth usage, especially for compressed images.
- Consider using Cloudinary for advanced image management features such as automatic format selection and responsive image delivery based on device capabilities.
- Integrate image optimization tools like Smush to automatically compress images upon upload, reducing load times and improving overall site performance.
- Be cautious of image formats; prefer modern formats like WebP for web applications to achieve better compression without sacrificing quality.
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms for image upload APIs to ensure that only authorized users can upload or modify images.
- Use consistent data formats (e.g., JSON) for API responses when dealing with image metadata to simplify integration and parsing on the client side.
- Monitor performance metrics related to image loading times and optimize CDN configurations to ensure fast delivery across different geographic locations.
- Regularly audit your image storage for unused or outdated images to save costs and improve management efficiency.
