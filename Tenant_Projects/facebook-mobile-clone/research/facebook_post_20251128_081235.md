## Summary

### Key Findings

- Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication using Firebase Authentication to securely manage user sessions and simplify login processes.
- Utilize the Facebook Graph API to post content such as profile status updates, ensuring you have the appropriate permissions and access tokens set up.
- Follow Material Design guidelines for Android and Human Interface Guidelines for iOS to create a consistent and user-friendly interface that mimics Facebook's design.
- Use real-time database features from Firebase to enable instant updates of posts and notifications across users' devices without needing to refresh the app.
- Ensure proper handling of media uploads (images, videos) by using multipart/form-data for API requests and implementing progress indicators for a better user experience.
- Implement pagination for displaying posts to manage data load efficiently and improve performance, especially when users have many friends or posts.
- Be mindful of rate limits imposed by the Facebook API to avoid service interruptions; implement exponential backoff strategies for handling API request failures.
- Secure user data by encrypting sensitive information both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.
- Test the app on various devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and usability, particularly for content-heavy features like news feeds and user profiles.
- Regularly update your app to incorporate the latest features from Facebook's API and address any deprecated methods to maintain compatibility.
