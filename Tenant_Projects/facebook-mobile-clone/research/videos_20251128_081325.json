    "Leverage WebRTC for real-time communication applications. Ensure to handle ICE candidates and STUN/TURN servers for reliable peer-to-peer connections, as outlined in the WebRTC documentation.",
    "Use the Media Source Extensions (MSE) API to programmatically manage media streams and enable adaptive streaming in web applications. This allows for better control over buffering and playback.",
    "When integrating video features, ensure authentication mechanisms are in place, such as OAuth 2.0 for API access, to secure video content and user data.",
    "Avoid common pitfalls such as hardcoding video URLs; instead, use a dynamic approach to fetch video streams based on user preferences or device capabilities.",
    "Consider using standardized data formats like MP4 or WebM for video files to ensure compatibility across different platforms and devices.",
    "Optimize video encoding settings for performance; use codecs like H.264 or VP9 for a balance between quality and file size, and test across various devices for playback consistency.",
    "Implement proper error handling for video playback to enhance user experience, including fallback mechanisms for unsupported formats or network issues.",
    "Regularly update your video libraries and frameworks to leverage new features and security patches, ensuring your application remains up-to-date with industry standards."
