## Summary

### Key Findings

- Utilize AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalable and reliable image storage solutions. Both platforms offer robust APIs for easy integration.
- Implement lazy loading for images to improve page load times and enhance user experience. Use the 'loading' attribute in the <img> tag or JavaScript libraries to defer loading off-screen images.
- Consider using WebP format for images to reduce file size without sacrificing quality. This can lead to faster loading times and reduced bandwidth usage.
- When processing images, leverage libraries like Sharp for Node.js to efficiently resize, convert, and optimize images on the server side.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization when accessing image storage APIs. Use OAuth 2.0 for secure access to cloud storage services.
- Adopt a consistent naming convention and directory structure for stored images to facilitate easier management and retrieval.
- Monitor image loading performance using tools like Google Lighthouse to identify and address any bottlenecks in image delivery.
- Be cautious of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when serving images from different domains. Configure CORS settings appropriately in your cloud storage.
- Implement caching strategies for images using HTTP headers to reduce server load and improve response times for frequently accessed images.

### Code Examples

#### Example 1
**Source**: Example: Asynchronous image upload to AWS S3
**Language**: javascript
```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

async function uploadImage(file) {
    const params = {
        Bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
        Key: file.name,
        Body: file.data,
        ContentType: file.mimetype,
    };
    return s3.upload(params).promise();
}
```

#### Example 2
**Source**: Example: Image optimization using Pillow
**Language**: python
```python
from PIL import Image

def optimize_image(input_path, output_path):
    with Image.open(input_path) as img:
        img.save(output_path, optimize=True, quality=85)
```
