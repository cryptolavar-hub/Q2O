    "Utilize FFmpeg for video processing tasks such as encoding, decoding, and format conversion. Refer to the official FFmpeg documentation for command-line options and library usage.",
    "For React Native applications, leverage the 'react-native-ffmpeg' library to integrate FFmpeg capabilities seamlessly. Ensure to follow the setup instructions carefully to avoid compatibility issues.",
    "When posting video reels, ensure that the video format is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms. H.264 for video and AAC for audio are widely supported formats.",
    "Implement MediaCodec on Android for efficient video encoding and decoding. This allows for hardware acceleration, improving performance during video processing.",
    "On iOS, use AVFoundation for video handling. Familiarize yourself with AVAsset and AVAssetExportSession for managing video files and exporting them in the desired format.",
    "Ensure proper authentication mechanisms are in place when integrating with APIs for video posting. OAuth 2.0 is a recommended approach for secure API access.",
    "Be mindful of data formats when uploading videos to ensure compatibility with backend services. Use multipart/form-data for file uploads to handle video files correctly.",
    "Optimize video size and quality before posting to improve upload speed and reduce server load. Consider implementing a compression step using FFmpeg or native libraries.",
    "Monitor performance metrics such as upload time and processing time to identify bottlenecks in the video posting workflow. Use profiling tools to gather insights.",
    "Prioritize security by validating video content and implementing rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure a smooth user experience."
