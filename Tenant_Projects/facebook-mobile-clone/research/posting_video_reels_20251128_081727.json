    "Utilize FFmpeg for video processing: Leverage FFmpeg's extensive capabilities for encoding, decoding, and manipulating video files before posting to ensure optimal quality and format compatibility.",
    "Integrate react-native-ffmpeg for React Native apps: Use the react-native-ffmpeg library to easily incorporate video processing features directly within your React Native application, facilitating seamless video reel creation.",
    "Implement react-native-video for playback: Use the react-native-video library to handle video playback efficiently, providing a smooth user experience when displaying video reels within your app.",
    "Follow Android media framework guidelines: Adhere to the Android media framework best practices to ensure your video posting functionality is compliant with platform standards and performs optimally on Android devices.",
    "Ensure proper video format and codec support: Before posting video reels, confirm that the video format (e.g., MP4) and codec (e.g., H.264) are supported by your target platforms to avoid playback issues.",
    "Optimize video size and resolution: Compress videos to reduce file size while maintaining acceptable quality, which can improve upload speed and reduce bandwidth usage for users.",
    "Implement authentication for secure uploads: Use OAuth or token-based authentication to secure the video posting process, ensuring that only authorized users can upload content.",
    "Handle API integration for video uploads: Ensure your backend API supports multipart/form-data for video uploads, and implement error handling for failed uploads to enhance user experience.",
    "Consider data format consistency: Maintain consistent data formats (e.g., JSON) for metadata associated with video reels to facilitate easier integration and processing on the server side.",
    "Monitor performance and security: Regularly assess the performance of video uploads and playback, and implement security measures such as HTTPS and input validation to protect against vulnerabilities."
