## Summary

### Key Findings

- Ensure URLs are SEO-friendly by using descriptive keywords and avoiding unnecessary parameters. This improves discoverability and user experience.
- Utilize canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues when multiple URLs lead to the same content. This helps consolidate link equity.
- Implement proper HTTP status codes (e.g., 301 for permanent redirects, 404 for not found) to guide search engines and users effectively.
- Use semantic HTML5 elements, such as <a> for links, to enhance accessibility and improve the structure of your URLs.
- Regularly audit your URLs for broken links and redirect chains to maintain site performance and user satisfaction.
- Consider user privacy and data protection when displaying friend lists or follower information in URLs. Use anonymization techniques if necessary.
- Adopt a consistent URL structure across your application to improve usability and make it easier for users to navigate.
- Integrate social sharing features that allow users to easily share URLs with their friends, enhancing engagement and visibility.
- Monitor URL performance using analytics tools to identify high-traffic pages and optimize them for better user retention.
- Ensure that your API endpoints for retrieving friend lists and associated URLs are secured with proper authentication mechanisms to protect user data.
