    "Utilize Sage's REST API for data extraction. Ensure you authenticate using OAuth 2.0 as per the official documentation to securely connect to the Sage database.",

    "Implement a data transformation layer between Sage and Odoo to handle discrepancies in data models. Use libraries like `Joi` or `Yup` in your NextJS application to validate and transform data before sending it to Odoo.",
    "Design the NextJS dashboard to provide real-time status updates on migration tasks. Use WebSockets or polling mechanisms to keep the UI responsive and informed of the migration progress.",
    "Consider batch processing for large data sets during migration to avoid hitting API rate limits. Implement pagination in your API calls to Sage and Odoo to manage data flow effectively.",
    "Ensure robust error handling and logging in your application. Capture API response errors and provide meaningful feedback in the UI to facilitate troubleshooting.",
    "Be mindful of data consistency during migration. Implement checks to verify that records in Sage are accurately reflected in Odoo after migration.",
