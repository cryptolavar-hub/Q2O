    "Implement webhooks to trigger inventory updates automatically when eCommerce transactions occur, reducing the risk of stock discrepancies.",
    "Utilize the Odoo HTTP API to create a seamless connection between the eCommerce frontend and the inventory backend, ensuring that product availability is always up-to-date.",
    "Follow the best practice of using Odoo's built-in security features, such as user roles and access rights, to restrict admin panel access to authorized personnel only.",
    "Ensure data consistency by using the same data formats (JSON) for API requests and responses when integrating eCommerce features with inventory management.",
    "To enhance performance, consider caching frequently accessed inventory data in the dashboard to reduce API call frequency and improve load times.",
    "Be aware of common pitfalls such as failing to handle API rate limits, which can lead to service disruptions; implement exponential backoff strategies for retries.",
    "Regularly monitor and log API interactions to identify bottlenecks or security issues, ensuring that both performance and security are maintained.",
    "Test the integration thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production to catch any integration issues between the eCommerce and inventory systems."
