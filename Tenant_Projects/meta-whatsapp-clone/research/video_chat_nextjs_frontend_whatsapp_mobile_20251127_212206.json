    "Implement WebRTC for real-time video and audio communication. Utilize RTCPeerConnection for establishing peer-to-peer connections and managing media streams effectively.",
    "Use signaling servers to facilitate the initial connection setup between clients. Consider using WebSocket or Socket.io for real-time signaling to exchange session descriptions and ICE candidates.",
    "Ensure cross-browser compatibility by testing WebRTC features across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Use feature detection to handle browser-specific implementations.",
    "Incorporate user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure video chat sessions. Utilize OAuth 2.0 or JWT for managing user sessions and permissions.",
    "Optimize media quality by implementing adaptive bitrate streaming. Use the getUserMedia API to access device cameras and microphones while allowing users to select video/audio quality settings.",
    "Implement fallback mechanisms for users with poor network conditions. Consider using lower resolution video streams or switching to audio-only mode when necessary.",
    "Utilize Next.js API routes to manage backend interactions, such as user data retrieval and session management, ensuring a seamless integration with your frontend.",
    "Be mindful of data formats when exchanging signaling messages. Use JSON for structured data and ensure proper serialization and deserialization to avoid communication issues.",
    "Regularly monitor performance metrics such as latency and bandwidth usage during video calls. Use tools like WebRTC's getStats API to gather insights and optimize performance.",
    "Prioritize security by using HTTPS for all communications and implementing end-to-end encryption for video streams to protect user privacy."
