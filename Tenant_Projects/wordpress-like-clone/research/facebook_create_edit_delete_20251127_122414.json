    "Utilize FFmpeg for video manipulation: Leverage FFmpeg's extensive capabilities for creating, editing, and deleting videos programmatically. Familiarize yourself with its command-line interface for efficient processing.",
    "Implement WebRTC for real-time video: Use WebRTC for real-time video streaming and interaction features in your application. This is particularly useful for live content creation and social media engagement.",
    "Follow Facebook's Graph API for video uploads: Use the Facebook Graph API to handle video uploads and management. Ensure you are familiar with the required permissions and access tokens for successful API interactions.",
    "Use Flask or Express for backend services: Choose Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js) to build your backend services for handling video uploads and social media interactions. These frameworks provide robust routing and middleware support.",
    "Ensure proper authentication for API access: Implement OAuth 2.0 for authenticating users with Facebook's API. This is crucial for posting videos and managing user permissions securely.",
    "Handle video formats and encoding: Be aware of the required video formats and encoding settings when uploading to Facebook. Use H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec for compatibility.",
    "Implement error handling for API calls: Always include error handling in your API interactions, particularly for video uploads. Check for common errors like permission issues and file size limits.",
    "Optimize video size and quality: Before uploading, optimize video files for size and quality to ensure faster uploads and better performance on social media platforms.",
    "Test across different devices: Ensure that your video content is tested across various devices and browsers to maintain compatibility and a seamless user experience.",
    "Monitor performance and security: Regularly assess the performance of video uploads and the security of your application, particularly focusing on data protection and secure API access."
