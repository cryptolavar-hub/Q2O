## Summary

### Key Findings

- Leverage the WordPress REST API to create, read, update, and delete content programmatically. This allows for a decoupled architecture, enabling you to build a front-end using frameworks like React or Vue.js.
- Utilize WordPress themes and plugins to extend functionality. Familiarize yourself with the WordPress Plugin Handbook to understand how to create custom plugins that can add features without modifying core files.
- Follow the WordPress coding standards to maintain code quality and ensure compatibility with future updates. This includes proper naming conventions, file organization, and documentation practices.
- Implement user authentication using the built-in WordPress user management system. Use the REST API's authentication methods (like OAuth or Application Passwords) to secure your endpoints.
- Be mindful of performance by utilizing caching mechanisms, such as object caching with Redis or using a plugin like W3 Total Cache, to reduce database load and improve response times.
- Ensure security by validating and sanitizing all user inputs. Use WordPress functions like `sanitize_text_field()` and `wp_nonce_field()` to protect against common vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.
- Adopt a modular approach in your codebase by separating concerns. Use custom post types for different content types and taxonomies for categorization, which enhances maintainability and scalability.
- Monitor and optimize database queries to avoid performance bottlenecks. Use the Query Monitor plugin to identify slow queries and optimize them as necessary.
- Integrate third-party APIs carefully, ensuring you handle data formats (JSON, XML) appropriately and manage API rate limits to avoid service disruptions.
- Regularly back up your WordPress instance and database to prevent data loss. Use plugins like UpdraftPlus or configure server-level backups for a reliable recovery strategy.

### Code Examples

#### Example 1
**Source**: Basic WordPress theme structure
**Language**: php
```php
<?php
// functions.php
function my_theme_setup() {
    add_theme_support('title-tag');
    add_theme_support('post-thumbnails');

    the_content();
endwhile; endif;
get_footer();
```

#### Example 2
**Source**: Creating a custom post type
**Language**: php
```php
<?php
function create_custom_post_type() {
    register_post_type('custom_type', array(
        'labels' => array(
            'name' => __('Custom Types'),
            'singular_name' => __('Custom Type')
        ),
        'public' => true,
        'has_archive' => true,
    ));
}
add_action('init', 'create_custom_post_type');
```
