    "Leverage the WordPress REST API to create, read, update, and delete content programmatically. This allows for a decoupled architecture, enabling you to build a front-end using frameworks like React or Vue.js.",
    "Utilize WordPress themes and plugins to extend functionality. Familiarize yourself with the WordPress Plugin Handbook to understand how to create custom plugins that can add features without modifying core files.",
    "Follow the WordPress coding standards to maintain code quality and ensure compatibility with future updates. This includes proper naming conventions, file organization, and documentation practices.",
    "Implement user authentication using the built-in WordPress user management system. Use the REST API's authentication methods (like OAuth or Application Passwords) to secure your endpoints.",
    "Be mindful of performance by utilizing caching mechanisms, such as object caching with Redis or using a plugin like W3 Total Cache, to reduce database load and improve response times.",
    "Ensure security by validating and sanitizing all user inputs. Use WordPress functions like `sanitize_text_field()` and `wp_nonce_field()` to protect against common vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.",
    "Adopt a modular approach in your codebase by separating concerns. Use custom post types for different content types and taxonomies for categorization, which enhances maintainability and scalability.",
    "Monitor and optimize database queries to avoid performance bottlenecks. Use the Query Monitor plugin to identify slow queries and optimize them as necessary.",
    "Integrate third-party APIs carefully, ensuring you handle data formats (JSON, XML) appropriately and manage API rate limits to avoid service disruptions.",
    "Regularly back up your WordPress instance and database to prevent data loss. Use plugins like UpdraftPlus or configure server-level backups for a reliable recovery strategy."
