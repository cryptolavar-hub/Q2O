    "Implement SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) for establishing and managing VoIP calls, as outlined in RFC 3261. Ensure your application can handle SIP signaling effectively.",
    "Utilize WebRTC for real-time communication in web applications. Leverage the WebRTC API to simplify peer-to-peer connections, enabling audio and video calls without requiring additional plugins.",
    "Incorporate RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) for the transmission of audio and video over IP networks, following the specifications in RFC 3550 to ensure timely delivery and synchronization of media streams.",
    "Secure your VoIP communications by implementing SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) as described in RFC 3711. This will encrypt the media streams and provide integrity and authentication.",
    "Adopt a modular architecture for VoIP applications, separating signaling, media handling, and user interface components. This promotes maintainability and scalability as your application grows.",
    "Ensure compatibility with various data formats for audio and video codecs. Common formats include Opus for audio and VP8/VP9 for video, which are widely supported in WebRTC.",
    "Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for network issues, such as packet loss or latency, to enhance the user experience during VoIP calls.",
    "Regularly test your VoIP application under different network conditions to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize for low-latency communication.",
    "Integrate authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or token-based authentication, to secure access to your VoIP services and protect user data."
