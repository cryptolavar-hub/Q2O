    "Utilize WebSocket for real-time communication in group chat applications to achieve low latency and bidirectional data transfer. Refer to the MDN WebSocket documentation for implementation details.",

    "Implement 'rooms' in Socket.IO to manage different chat groups efficiently. This allows users to join or leave specific chat rooms without affecting others. Check the Socket.IO rooms documentation for usage patterns.",
    "Ensure proper authentication for users joining chat rooms to prevent unauthorized access. Use JWT or session-based authentication to secure WebSocket connections.",
    "Adopt JSON as the data format for message payloads in your group chat application to ensure compatibility and ease of parsing across different platforms.",
    "Implement message throttling or debouncing to prevent flooding the server with too many messages in a short period, which can degrade performance.",
    "Be mindful of security implications such as Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Monitor and log WebSocket connections and disconnections to help diagnose issues and improve user experience by understanding usage patterns.",
    "Consider using a message queue (like Redis) for scaling your chat application, especially if you expect high traffic, to manage message delivery between users effectively."
