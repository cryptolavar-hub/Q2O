  "key_findings": [
    "\"**Enhanced Traceability and Transparency**: Blockchain provides an immutable, auditable ledger for every step of a supply chain, from raw material sourcing to final delivery, significantly increasing transparency and trust among participants.\",",
    "\"**Smart Contract Automation**: Solidity smart contracts can automate critical supply chain processes like payments upon delivery, quality checks, or ownership transfers, reducing manual intervention, delays, and potential for disputes.\",",
    "\"**Data Immutability and Integrity**: Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of supply chain records, crucial for combating counterfeiting and verifying product origins.\",",
    "\"**Decentralized Trust**: Eliminates the need for a central authority, as all participants can verify transactions independently, fostering a more resilient and trustworthy ecosystem.\",",
    "\"**Scalability and Cost Challenges**: Public blockchains (like Ethereum mainnet) can incur high gas fees and have limited transaction throughput, necessitating consideration of Layer 2 solutions, private/consortium blockchains, or off-chain data storage for large-scale operations.\",",
    "\"**Integration Complexity**: Connecting existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, IoT devices, and other legacy systems with blockchain infrastructure requires robust integration layers and careful data synchronization strategies.\",",
    "\"**Data Privacy Concerns**: While transaction data is public on many blockchains, sensitive business information or personal data needs careful handling, often requiring off-chain storage with on-chain hashes or zero-knowledge proofs.\",",
    "\"**Governance and Legal Frameworks**: Establishing clear governance models for consortium blockchains and navigating the evolving legal landscape for smart contracts and digital assets are critical for adoption and compliance.\"",
