# Root Folder Cleanup - Final Actions

## Date: 2025-11-25

## Actions Completed

### 1. Moved Project-Generated Files from Root `src/` Folder

**Files Moved:**
- `src/follow_web3.py` → `Tenant_Projects/blockchain-based-supply-chain-management-system/src/follow_web3.py`
- `src/mention_typical_user.py` → `Tenant_Projects/saas-platform-for-managing-remote-teams/src/mention_typical_user.py`
- `src/responsive_design_mobile.py` → `Tenant_Projects/farmers-and-growers-mobile-app/src/responsive_design_mobile.py`

**Reasoning:**
- `follow_web3.py` - Related to blockchain/Web3 functionality, matches blockchain project
- `mention_typical_user.py` - Has research files in saas-platform-for-managing-remote-teams project
- `responsive_design_mobile.py` - Mobile-related, matches farmers mobile app project

**Status:** ✅ All files moved successfully

### 2. Updated .gitignore

**Added:**
- `.coverage_reports/` - Coverage reports folder (generated by TestingAgent)

**Location:** Added to "Unit test / coverage reports" section

**Status:** ✅ Updated

### 3. Cleaned Up Empty Folders

**Deleted:**
- `src/` folder (empty after moving files)
- `.coverage_reports/` folder (empty, generated folder)

**Status:** ✅ Cleaned up

## Verification

All project-generated files have been moved to their correct `Tenant_Projects/{project_id}/` folders. Root folder now only contains platform/system folders.

## Prevention

The safe file writer system (`utils/safe_file_writer.py`) now prevents future corruption:
- All file writes validated to be within `Tenant_Projects/{project_id}/`
- Path traversal attacks blocked
- Protected system folders/files cannot be overwritten

## Summary

✅ **3 files moved** to correct project folders
✅ **.gitignore updated** to exclude `.coverage_reports/`
✅ **Empty folders cleaned up**
✅ **Root folder is now clean**

The root folder corruption issue has been resolved, and the hard guarantee system prevents future occurrences.
