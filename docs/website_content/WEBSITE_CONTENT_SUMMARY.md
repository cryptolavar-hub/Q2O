## 💰 THE PRICING STRATEGY (CLEARLY EXPLAINED)

### **Tier 1: Platform Subscription** (Licensing Addon)

**What It Is**: Monthly/annual fee for software access

**Plans**:
```
Starter:     $99/month  (10 migrations/month)
Pro:         $299/month (50 migrations/month)  ← MOST POPULAR
Enterprise:  $999/month (200 migrations/month)
```

**What You Get**:
- Access to Quick2Odoo platform
- 11 AI agents
- All 40+ platform support
- Support (tiered by plan)
- Custom branding (Pro+)
- API access (Pro+)

**Billed**: Monthly or annually (17% discount annual)

---

### **Tier 2: Migration Service Fees** (Quick2Odoo Billing)

**What It Is**: Per-migration charge based on data volume

**Pricing Factors**:
1. **Base tier** (Starter $200, Professional $500, Enterprise $1,500)
2. **Years of data** (each year adds 10-20% to base)
3. **Record count** (extra records charged per 1K)
4. **Platform complexity** (multiplier: 1.0x to 2.0x)

**Example**:
```
QuickBooks Online Migration:
├─ Base (Professional tier): $500
├─ 5 years of data: ×1.75 = $875
├─ 10,000 records (5K extra): +$150 = $1,025
├─ Platform (QB): ×1.2 = $1,230
├─ Pro plan discount (-5%): = $1,169
└─ Final cost: ~$1,169
```

**Billed**: Per migration (one-time charge)

---

### **Why Both Models?**

**Subscription** = Software license + quota  
**Migration Fee** = Actual service delivery

It's like:
- **AWS**: Reserved instances + usage charges
- **Adobe**: Monthly subscription + print costs
- **Uber**: Platform fee + per-ride charges

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Fair for everyone (light users pay less)
- ✅ Predictable costs (subscription is fixed)
- ✅ Scales with usage (heavy users pay more)
- ✅ Two revenue streams (recurring + usage)
