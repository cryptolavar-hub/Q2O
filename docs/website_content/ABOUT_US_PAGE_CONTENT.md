## 📖 OUR STORY SECTION

### **Headline**
```
Born from Real-World Pain
```

### **Story Content** (2-column layout)

**Left Column: The Problem**
```
In 2024, our founder was implementing Odoo for a mid-sized manufacturing client. 
The technical work? Done in 2 weeks. The data migration from their legacy ERP? 
6 weeks of hell.

We spent countless hours:
• Reverse-engineering poorly documented APIs
• Writing custom extraction scripts
• Manually mapping 1,000+ fields
• Debugging data integrity issues at 2 AM
• Re-running migrations after discovering edge cases

The client was happy. But we knew there had to be a better way.
```

**Right Column: The Vision**
```
We asked ourselves: What if AI agents could do this work?

• What if a ResearcherAgent could scrape API documentation automatically?
• What if a CoderAgent could generate extraction scripts in minutes?
• What if a TestingAgent could write comprehensive test suites?
• What if consultants could focus on business logic, not data plumbing?

Quick2Odoo was born from that vision.

Today, we're helping 50+ IT consultants migrate clients to Odoo 10x faster 
than traditional methods. The manual work is automated. The quality is 
consistently high. And consultants are winning more business.
