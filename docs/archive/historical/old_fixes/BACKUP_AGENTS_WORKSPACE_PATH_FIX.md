# Backup Agents Workspace Path Fix

## Critical Issue
Project-generated files were appearing in the root folder (`C:\Q2O_Combined\`) instead of in the `Tenant_Projects` folder where they should be.

## Root Cause
In `main.py`, backup agents were being created **without** the `workspace_path` parameter:

```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY):
CoderAgent(agent_id="coder_backup", **{k: v for k, v in agent_kwargs.items() if k != "workspace_path"})
```

This caused backup agents to default to `workspace_path="."` (the current working directory), which is the project root (`C:\Q2O_Combined\`). When backup agents were used (which happens when main agents are busy or fail), they saved files to the root directory instead of the correct `Tenant_Projects/{project_id}/` folder.

## Impact
- Files generated by backup agents were saved to the wrong location
- Root folder became cluttered with project files
- Potential file corruption if files with the same name existed in root
- Difficulty determining which files belong to which project

## Fix Applied
Updated all backup agent initializations to **include** `workspace_path`:

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
CoderAgent(agent_id="coder_backup", **agent_kwargs)  # workspace_path now included
```

All backup agents now receive the correct `workspace_path` pointing to `Tenant_Projects/{project_id}/`.

## Agents Fixed
- ✅ CoderAgent (backup)
- ✅ TestingAgent (backup)
- ✅ QAAgent (backup)
- ✅ InfrastructureAgent (backup)
- ✅ IntegrationAgent (backup)
- ✅ FrontendAgent (backup)
- ✅ WorkflowAgent (backup)
- ✅ SecurityAgent (backup)
- ✅ ResearcherAgent (backup)
- ✅ NodeAgent (backup)

## Files Modified
- `main.py` - Fixed all backup agent initializations to include `workspace_path`

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All backup agents now use the correct workspace path, ensuring files are saved to `Tenant_Projects/{project_id}/` instead of the root folder.

## Next Steps
1. **Clean up root folder**: Review files in `C:\Q2O_Combined\` and determine which belong to projects vs. system files
2. **Move project files**: If any project files are in root, move them to their respective `Tenant_Projects/{project_id}/` folders
3. **Verify**: Run a test project to confirm files are now saved to the correct location
